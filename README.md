Hereâ€™s the API documentation and a MongoDB schema setup for the "Nudge" feature based on your requirements. This includes details on how to create, read, update, and delete nudges, along with the MongoDB model.

API Documentation for Nudge Creation
Overview
The Nudge feature allows users to create nudges associated with events or articles. Users can tag an event, provide a title, upload an image, schedule the timing, and describe the nudge.

User Interface Components
Tag Event/Article: User can tag the relevant event or article for which the nudge is created.
Title: A field for the user to input the title of the nudge (maximum 60 characters).
Image Upload: Users can upload an image to serve as a cover for the nudge.
Scheduled Timing: Users can specify the date and time for sending the nudge.
Scheduled On: Date format (dd/mm/yy)
Timings: From (hh
) to (hh
)
Description: A detailed description of the nudge.
Invitation Text: A short one-line invitation for displaying alongside the nudge.
Steps to Implement
Wireframe Review: Go through the wireframe provided to understand the structure.
Data Model: Create a MongoDB data model for the Nudge based on the specifications.
API Structure: Document the API structure, including:
Request types (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
Base URL
API Endpoints
Payload specifications
Description of the API functionality
Reference Table: Utilize the previous table (Table 1) for guidance on request formats.
CRUD Documentation: Write comprehensive documentation for all CRUD functionalities related to Nudge creation.
Example of API Endpoints
1. Create a Nudge
POST /api/v3/app/nudges
Description: Create a new nudge.
Payload:
json
Copy code
{
  "tag": "string",
  "title": "string (max 60 characters)",
  "image": "file",
  "scheduled_on": "date (dd/mm/yy)",
  "timings": {
    "from": "time (hh:mm)",
    "to": "time (hh:mm)"
  },
  "description": "string",
  "invitation_text": "string"
}
2. Retrieve a Nudge
GET /api/v3/app/nudges/:id
Description: Retrieve a nudge by its unique ID.
3. Update a Nudge
PUT /api/v3/app/nudges/:id
Description: Update an existing nudge.
Payload: Same as POST payload.
4. Delete a Nudge
DELETE /api/v3/app/nudges/:id
Description: Delete a nudge by its unique ID.
MongoDB Model for Nudge
Here's how you can structure your MongoDB model for the Nudge feature using Mongoose (Node.js library for MongoDB):

javascript
Copy code
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const nudgeSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  tag: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    maxlength: 60
  },
  image: {
    type: String, // You can store the image URL or path
    required: true
  },
  scheduled_on: {
    type: Date,
    required: true
  },
  timings: {
    from: {
      type: String, // Use a string format "hh:mm"
      required: true
    },
    to: {
      type: String, // Use a string format "hh:mm"
      required: true
    }
  },
  description: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  invitation_text: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  }
}, { timestamps: true });

const Nudge = mongoose.model('Nudge', nudgeSchema);

module.exports = Nudge;
Additional Notes
Ensure that the image uploaded is handled correctly and validate the timing input.
Implement proper error handling for all API requests to enhance user experience.
Use middleware for validating data before processing requests.
This setup should provide a solid foundation for the Nudge feature in your application, integrating both the API documentation and the MongoDB schema. If you need further modifications or additions, feel free to ask!
