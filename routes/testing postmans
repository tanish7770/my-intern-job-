5. Testing with Postman
Now you can use Postman to test each endpoint of your API:

GET /api/v3/app/events?id=<event_id>
GET /api/v3/app/events?type=latest&limit=5&page=1
POST /api/v3/app/events with the appropriate JSON payload.
PUT /api/v3/app/events/:id with the updated data.
DELETE /api/v3/app/events/:id.
